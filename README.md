# Angular 18 Project Documentation

## Overview

This project is built using Angular 18, a powerful framework for building web applications. Angular 18 introduces several new features and improvements that enhance the developer experience and application performance.

## New Features in Angular 18

### 1. **Standalone Components**
Angular 18 continues to improve support for standalone components, allowing developers to create self-contained components that can be used without the need for NgModules. This leads to a more streamlined application structure.

### 2. **Signal-based Reactive Programming**
Angular 18 introduces a new signal-based reactive programming model that simplifies state management and change detection. This model enables more intuitive handling of reactive data, making it easier to manage and update application state.

### 3. **Enhanced CLI Capabilities**
The Angular CLI has been updated to include new commands and options, enhancing project scaffolding and development workflows. Developers can now generate components, services, and other artifacts with improved templates and options.

### 4. **Typed Forms**
Angular 18 introduces typed forms, allowing developers to create forms with stricter type checking. This feature improves type safety, making it easier to work with form data and reducing runtime errors.

### 5. **Improved Performance**
Angular 18 comes with performance enhancements, including faster rendering and smaller bundle sizes. The framework optimizes change detection and other internal processes, leading to better application responsiveness.

### 6. **New APIs and Features**
- **Directive Composition API**: This new API allows developers to compose directives more flexibly, promoting code reuse and better organization of logic.
- **Enhancements in HTTP Client**: The HTTP client now includes improved error handling and response transformation, simplifying API interactions.
- **Experimental Features**: Angular 18 introduces experimental features that can be enabled for testing, allowing developers to preview upcoming capabilities.
